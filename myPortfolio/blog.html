  <h4>What Do You Think the "Cascade" is?</h4>
  <body>
    The Cascade is a mechanism that controls or provides order relatiing to
    inheritance (elements that take property values from their parents but not
    others). The Cascade indicates the order of CSS rules. Cascade uses three
    factors to determine what selectors win out when they share the same
    element.

    <h3>Explain the 3 ways to use CSS to style anhtml file.</h3>
    One way to link CSS to html is by inline styling. By using this method we
    can apply CSS styles inhtml as a single, specific element which applies CSS
    directly in the html page. The second way is using the
    <style></style> method which should be used at the beginning of the
    document. This method should only be for styles within a particular page.
    The third and most effective way to link CSS is by creating a external style
    sheet, or keeping CSS in its own file and referencing it in the index.html
    file.

    <h3>How would you explain the way CSS works outloud to someone?</h3>
    CSS plays the biggest role in organizing a unique, creative webpage for a
    coder. It cleans up and polishes the content that is created in html with
    its many features and styles. CSS rules describe how HTML elements are to be
    displayed/styled on the screen by the browser.

    <h4>
      How do you choose the correct CSS selector?
    </h4>
    We choose the correct selector by stating the element we are selecting from
    the document and giving it some rules to follow.
