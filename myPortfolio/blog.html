  <body>
    What excites me about coding is the endless possibilities of being able to
    channel creativity in ways that help change the world. To be able to face
    the reality that people worldwide can actually benefit from my contributions
    and work is an exciting and scary inspiration. Also, the fact that my work
    could range from impact corporations up to mobile app development excites
    me, this is a very innovative area in life that brings purpose.

    <h3>What does doctype do at the top of your code?</h3>
    Doctype specifies the rules for the markup language so browsers render the
    content correctly. We should always add Doctype declaration to our HTML
    documents so the browser knows what type of document to expect (Sends
    instruction to the web browser about what version of the markup language the
    page is written in).

    <h3>Explain How A Browser Determines What Elements Match a CSS Selector</h3>
    Browsers filter out elements in the DOM according to the key selector, and
    traverse up its parent elemnets to determine matches, the shorter the length
    of the selector chain, the faster the browser can determine if element
    matches selector (Selector p span- browser finds all span elements, traverse
    up its parent to find p elements).
